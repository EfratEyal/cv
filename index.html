  <p>I have 6 years of experience working in Instructional Design and Web Development.
    Currently, I work as an Instructional Designer at <a href="https://checkmarx.com/product/codebashing-secure-code-training/">Checkmarx</a>,
    where I develop an enganging learning experience for both employees and customers,
    building unique gamified lessons that are helping people achieve more in their careers!
    I'm deeply passionate about creating loved and trusted products that help people learn and achieve their career goals.</p>

  <p>Previously, I worked at IBM, LiveU and Animals-Now as an Instructional Designer and as a Web Development Team Leader on the last bit,
    improving products and services for learners and users by advanced analytics,
    setting up big-data analytical tools (i.e. Google Analytics), creating and maintaining models, and onboarding new data sets.</p>

  <p>If you catch me outside of work, I'm on my way to a drumming lesson - and an avid lover of animals!</p>

  <p>I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:efrat.eyal@protonmail.com">efrat.eyal@protonmail.com</a> or DM on LinkeIn.</p>
